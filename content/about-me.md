Hi, I'm a penetration tester from Spain fascinated with hacking and generally with every field about cybersecurity, from its application in cyber warfare to drones. I consider myself a constant apprentice and I like to learn from what I do. Currently I hold Security+ and OSCP certifications.

My intention is contribute through this blog resources, knowledge or experiences that may be useful in some way to someone in this world.
