As I mentioned in my [OSCP Review](https://xma.cyber-ops.es/posts/oscp-2020-review/) I had done all the Linux and Windows HackTheBox machines from the TJnull OSCP-like machines list (existent until that moment), and also a few from the "More challenging" column, but I consider these my top 10 of OSCP-like boxes of HackTheBox based in the learning experience:

1. **Sniper**
2. **Conceal**
3. **Tally**
4. **Jarvis**
5. **Bankrobber** (difficult but you'll be able to practice with a specific exploitation which is VERY common in penetration testing world and which you won't be able to get practice in, as far as I know, any other machine on HTB)
6. **Active** 
7. **SolidState**
8. **Fortune** (Quite more difficult and not in the list of TJNull but I'd add it. It gets you involved in many techniques that you will practice on OSCP)
9. **Brainfuck** (Just until you get a shell as user. Privesc is sick and not OSCP at all)
10. **Bart**

And here some other boxes not really OSCP-like but that I also consider a must since you will exploit different kind of technologies widely used today (some even also involved in OSCP but whose exploitation may not be the same):

1. **Craft**
2. **Mango** (TJNull added it recently to his list but I wouldn't add it)
3. **Forest** (the same that I said for Mango)
4. **Registry**
5. **Silo**
6. **Monteverde**
